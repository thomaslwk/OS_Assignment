# Operating Systems Assignment
Documentation for OS module assignment. 

## Assignment Description: 
### Task 1: Improved Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm 
Paper (5): Round Robin, Shortest Job First and Priority algorithm coupled to increase throughput and decrease waiting time and turnaround time. 

### How to run
Replicate Paper's example test cases. 
* Example 1: `./p5_testinput < input_test_1.txt`
* Example 2: `./p5_testinput < input_test_2.txt`

### Algorithm input 
Input Requirement: 
* Number of process 
* Time quantum 
* Burst time for each process 
* Arrival time for process 
* Priority level for process (value 1 to 3) 

Format: 
`no. of process, time quantum, burst time, arrival time, priority`


### Task 2: Race Condition Simulation with Process 
C program to illustrate Race condition. Requires minimal use of 5 processes and 3 resources.
