### Improved Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm

Round Robin, Shortest Job First and Priority algorithm coupled to increase throughput and decrease waiting time and turnaround time.

Strength of algorithm dynamic allocation of time quantum for each process based on process priority. 
Checks for 3 special condition for each process. If condition met, algorithm will execute entire process at once. 

See flow diagram. 

## How to run
Replicate Paper's 2 example cases. 
* Example 1: `./pp < input_test_1.txt`

* Example 2: `./pp < input_test_2.txt`

## Algorithm input 
Input Requirement: 
* Number of process 
* Time quantum 
* Burst time for each process 
* Arrival time for process 
* Priority level for process (value 1 to 3) 

Format: 
`no. of process, time quantum, burst time, arrival time, priority`
